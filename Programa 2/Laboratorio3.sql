/*
Scanning through the entire dataset everytime to compare rows against a WHERE condition is wasteful. 
This is especially true if you only really care about records for a specific period of time like:

All transactions for the last year
All visitor interactions within the last 7 days
All products sold in the last month
Instead of scanning the entire dataset and filtering on a date field like we did in the earlier queries,
 we will now setup a date-partitioned table. This will allow us to completely ignore scanning records in certain partitions 
 if they are irrelevant to our query.
